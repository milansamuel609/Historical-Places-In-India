    <p>Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is said that this square shaped structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati. However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear.</p>
    <p>As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected the entire city immensely during that era. It is believed that the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering.</p>
    <p>It is also said that it was built in the memory of Prophet Muhammed's son in law who lost his life at the battle of Karbala as its design is in the shape of Shiya Tazias. Some also believe that the location of Charminar is the place where Sultan had seen his then future wife Bahgmati for the first time.</p>
    <p>The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years with a cost of Rs. 9 lakhs, which was around 2 lakhs huns/gold coins in those times. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation.</p>
    <p>There is another legend associated with the Charminar according to which, there is a secret underground tunnel that connects Charminar to the Golconda Fort. It was built for the royal family, to escape in case of any kind of emergencies. However, till date no tunnel could be found.</p>
